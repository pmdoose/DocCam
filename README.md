# Document Viewer Webcam

This is a very smple HTML wepage.
It is designed and intended for to allows docuemts to be viewed using either a webcam or a camera device which communicates in a similar way.

This was desiged as a cross platform substution for cumbersome software which is often bundled with document cameras.

It's intended use is to be used with the web browser it is being mirrored to a projected image.

Included features are 

Freeze the image
  Hotkey Space
Rotate the image
  Hotkeys , and . respectively
Zoom the image
  hotkeys + and - respectively or use the mousewheel
Pan the image
  Just drage the image or use the arrow keys
Full screen the image
  Hotkey Esc
  
Trapezoidal transform (To correct for Camera angle)
  (no current hotkeys)

My intention is to keep this full features yet simple to use/understand


Use: Just save the DocCam.html file and load it into a WebBrowser

Note: This can be hosted on a webserver but a secure connection will be required to allow webcamera permissions.
