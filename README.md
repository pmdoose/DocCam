# Document Viewer Webcam

This is a very smple HTML wepage.<br>
It is designed and intended for to allows docuemts to be viewed using either a webcam or a camera device which communicates in a similar way.<br>

This was desiged as a cross platform substution for cumbersome software which is often bundled with document cameras.<br>

It's intended use is to be used with the web browser it is being mirrored to a projected image.<br>

Included features are:<br><br>

* Freeze the image:<br>
  Hotkey Space
* Rotate the image:<br>
  Hotkeys , and . respectively:
* Zoom the image:<br>
  hotkeys + and - respectively or use the mousewheel
* Pan the image:<br>
  Just drage the image or use the arrow keys
* Full screen the image:<br>
  Hotkey Esc 
* Trapezoidal transform (To correct for Camera angle):<br>
  (no current hotkeys)

My intention is to keep this full features yet simple to use/understand<br><br><br>


Use: Just save the DocCam.html file and load it into a WebBrowser<br><br>

Note: This can be hosted on a webserver but a secure connection will be required to allow webcamera permissions.<br><br>
